Loop Dipole and the Chaoties is a 3D ground effect flying puzzle game that uses Blender 2.69 as its "game engine". Part racing game, part puzzle game, LDC is a single player experience designed to be rewarding, persistent, and just plain fun!


How to Play
========================
The purpose of the game is to travel around the planet collecting
different kinds of energy and using that energy to:
	1. Power Loop's alternate shapes.
	2. Power Loop's abilities.
	3. Solve the fountain puzzles.
	4. Destroy the Chaoties!
Solving the "Fountain Puzzles" will grant you more customization
points to adjust the stats of Loop's shapes more to your liking.
Also, solving all the puzzles on the six outer sides of the
cube planet will grant you access to the final level. Complete
the final level and you win the game!


Project Scope & Gameplay
========================

This is a long term project to create a game that specific game play elements that I have in mind. In its finished form it will be single player, have persistent world between sessions, and consist of seven maps (one for each side of Loop's cubic planet, plus the final level). The nature of the game play is to collect energy and use that energy to customize your character (looks and abilities), fight the bad guys (Chaoties), and balance the chaotic fountains of energy around the world (puzzles).

Character movement, specifically "going fast" with wacky physics, is a big part of the fun in the game. Just "driving" around the world doing nothing will be an enjoyable experience. Managing your energy types, by way of looking for them, collecting them, storing them, and using them should allow for endless organic gameplay. Beating the game, by solving all of the fountain puzzles (in no particular order), isHow to Play:

In fact, the whole game is designed to just be enjoyed; While you loose your cargo (which won't be much) and respawn at home when you loose all your health and the Chaoties can set you back by jumping into your fountain puzzles and messing up your projress, ultimately neither are really a big deal, because your only deadline is that of your finite mortal life. :)

With this in mind, I will be using the Blender Game Engine to facilitate all of the world, physics, etc. I will also add some basic enemy AI (spawn randomly, path toward the fountains, chase/attack the player when within range) and the seven unique levels, complete with custom music, sound effects, art, etc.


Art Style
=========
I am shooting for simple, clean, and fun. The world is made of wild energy constrained by coloured lines. The characters are beings of pure energy. Visually, the main character is made of anglular shapes and is of a solid color that has highlights which change depending on the lighting. The Chaoties are sparking blobs of multishaped whackiness! While this is simple to do in Blender, it's also cool looking and easy on system resources (as far as I can tell). I might do some texturing or vertex colors for shading, but any surface detailing would take away from the look I am going for. I may or may not add a glowing effect to the characters.

The shapes that Loop takes on are that of sci-fi inspired vehicles. Planes/jets, a tank, a mech, and a little car. He's a multifacited little guy!


Platforms
=========
Thanks to the Blender Player for BGE, the game (should) run on Linux, Windows, and MacOSX!


Timeline
========
This project will be completed some time before the heat death of our universe. Probably. I hope.


Contributions
=============
Overall, this project is being released under the GPL v3. As such, I will quote what the SuperTuxKart folks had to say about contributing to their project; I think they "nailed it"...

http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/Licensing

"Considerations to always keep in mind:

If you wish that your contribution be included in STK main or add-ons, always note down the author's name, website where image was found and full license name of everything you use (textures, models, sounds, etc.); when you make something yourself also note that you did it yourself and which license you release it under; we recommend making a file named "License.txt" to contain all this information; if we do not receive this information along your track/kart/etc., we will be legally unable to use your contribution in any way!

Also be sure that you have the right to actually release the art work under the license you chose. Some (typically commercial) software might restrict what you are allowed to do with anything created with that software."

With that in mind, if you have code fixes/suggestions/help, I am open to your feedback - I'm not a programming genius! However, when it comes to art, etc. I do not want unsolicited materials. Artistic advice, on the other hand, is more than welcome, because if there is one thing that I certainly am NOT, it's an artist! :) The bottom line is that I am doing this project, with all of its parts, as a hobby, because I enjoy doing these things - I *want* to do it by myself, even it it takes forever. Journey, not the destination... that whole thing...

So, if you do contact me with contributions or suggestions, first of all THANK YOU for taking the time, and secondly, please take a few extra moments to cite your sources we can ensure credit is given where credit is due.
