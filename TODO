-----------------


~~~~~~
- Add the Chaoties.

- Fountain puzzles will be on the "path" that the AI will follow, so if the player doens't stop them, they will at some point hit the fountains and then teleport somewhere else.

- Effects to Chaoties when player interacts with them, such as:
- Warp to random location on the map when hit by certain player abilities, destruction, conversion into cargo energy, etc.

- Randomize active pattern (level) upon interaction with a Chaoty.
- Display pattern, one shape at a time when the UI window is active.
- Remove energy from cargo bar upon button press (1 - 8) while at a fountain.
- If energy selected matches energy showing, change state of that part of pattern to solved.
- If energy selected did not match energy showing, the energy is just removed from the cargo bar (wasted essentially). 
- Move up to next pattern (level) when all parts of the current pattern are solved.
- Lock fountain as completed when all pattern (levels) are completed.
