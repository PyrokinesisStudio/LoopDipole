As things get more complicated, I thought it would be a good idea to explain what is going on in the blend files. For you and for me!

###################
start.blend
###################
- This is the file that gets loaded at the begining of the game. It shows profiles, settings, and start game.
- At this time, I am just playing around with various concepts to see what I can do and what I like.



###################
level#.blend
###################
- For the most part all these levels are same. They differ in music, lighting, and other "effects", but logic wise they all function in the same way.

- I use empty objects to hold variables (stats), because it helps to reduce clutter and can make it easier to accomplish some tasks.

Objects:

BaseStats
    - Empty that holds the handling stats for the player, based on the "vehicle demo" framework.
    - wheelRadius, wheelBase, wheelFrontoffset, wheelBackoffset, and AttachHeight are never changed.
    - The other stats are changed to, in part, create the different "shapes" the player can use.
    
Collision Box
    - Prevents the player from falling off the map.
    
Controller
    - Empty that handles global tasks.
    - Camera selection (keyboard events).
    - Restarts Game (keyboard event).
    - Loads music.
    
InventoryStats
    - Empty holding the player's inventory stats.
    - These variables are changed when picking up and using energy.
    
Planet
    - This is the "floor" of the map. 
    
PuzzleStats
    - Empty holding the current state of the Fountain Puzzles.
    - These variables are changed when the player or a Chaoty interacts with a Fountain.
    
SandBoxSun
    - Default map-wide lighting.
    
Wheel0 - Wheel3
    - Technically, the player is a car that has 4 wheels. 
    - Provide the handling interaction with the ground surfaces.
    - Set to invisible, but can be turned on for testing.
    
bare
    - This the player.
    audi
        - Collision box model for the player.
        - Required as it provides mass.
        - Set to invisible, but can be turned on for testing.    
    Loop_#_proxy
        - Visual player model, linked from assets/models/loop_shapes.blend
        - Non-collision (REQUIRED!) model for looks only.
        - These are changed to visible one at a time when the player picks a shape.
    Sky
        - Vertex parented sky shpere.
    cam2
        - Close and steady third person camera
    cam3
        - First person camera (a bit above player so the model shows)
        
cam0
    - "floaty" camera number 1

cam1
    - "floaty" camera number 2

shadow
    - Lamp that follows the player and casts his shadow.

target
    - I'm not sure at the moment... I think this is a left over from the fifth camera I removed...
