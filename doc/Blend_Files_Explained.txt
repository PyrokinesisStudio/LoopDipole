As things get more complicated, I thought it would be a good idea to explain
what is going on in the blend files. For you and for me!

IMPORTANT: All blend files reference/use/REQUIRE external files.

###################
start.blend
###################
- This is the file that gets loaded at the begining of the game. It shows
profiles, settings, and starts game.

- As of Jan 2016, all it does is load the game (and isn't needed to do so).


###################
level1.blend
###################
- The main level of the game, hosting objects and logic bricks.

- I use empty objects to hold variables, logic and to organize objects, because it helps to
reduce clutter and can make it easier to accomplish some tasks.


Objects:

BaseStats
    - Empty that holds the handling stats for the player, based on the "vehicle demo" framework.
    - wheelRadius, wheelBase, wheelFrontoffset, wheelBackoffset, and AttachHeight are never changed.
    - The other stats are changed to, in part, create the different "shapes" the player can use.

BorderBox
    - Prevents the player from falling off the map.

ColourParts
    - Empty holding the lined platforms/floors that make up the level.

Controller
    - Empty that handles global tasks.
    - Camera selection (keyboard events).
    - Restarts Game (keyboard event).
    - Loads music, UI, etc.

InventoryStats
    - Empty holding the player's inventory stats.
    - These variables are changed when picking up and using energy.

Projectile
    - Cube used as a pojectile for shooting stuff.
    - Mostly for testing at this point.

PuzzleStats
    - Empty holding the current state of the Fountain Puzzles.
    - These variables are changed when the player or a Chaoty interacts with a Fountain.

Ribbons
    - Empty holding the template ribbons (roads) as well the fully built roadways.

SandBoxSun
    - Default map-wide lighting.

Target
    - Cylinder to shoot at while testing.

Target Spawn
    - The place at which the test cylinders emerge from the void!

Wheel0 - Wheel3
    - Technically, the player is a car that has 4 wheels.
    - Provide the handling interaction with the ground surfaces.
    - Set to invisible, but can be turned on for testing.

bare
    - This the player.
    Abilities
        - This is an empty that holds the logic for the player abilities.
        - I am working on this as Feb 2015.
    audi
        - Collision box model for the player.
        - Required as it provides mass.
        - Set to invisible, but can be turned on for testing.
    Loop_#_proxy
        - Visual player model, linked from assets/models/loop_shapes.blend
        - Non-collision (REQUIRED!) model for looks only.
        - These are changed to visible one at a time when the player picks a shape.
    Sky
        - Vertex parented sky shpere.
    cam2
        - Close and steady third person camera
    cam3
        - First person camera (a bit above player so the model shows)

cam0
    - "floaty" camera number 1

cam1
    - "floaty" camera number 2

target
    - I'm not sure at the moment... I think this is a left over from the fifth camera I removed...


###################
assets/models/loop_shapes.blend
###################
    - Linked library file for the character shapes.
    - I made each shape in its own scene.
