Loop Dipole and the Chaoties
============================
Player Abilities

----------------------------

There are 8 abilities that the player can unlock. He may use up to two abilities at a time, one bound to the LMB and the other bound to the RMB. Each ability requires its own type of energy. Equipping an ability requires x amount of x type of energy be available in the player's inventory. Once equipped, the player may fire that ability up to 8 times before needing to reload. To reload, the player can either changes shapes at a nexus or press the R Key at any time. In order for the R key to work, the player must have the proper type energy in his toolbar. Abilities charge at a 1:1 ratio (shots : energy of the right kind in the toolbar).

Abilities do not have cooldowns / reuse timers unless one is specified.

The "default combat ability" is same thing as emptying a toolbar number slot to free up the space: When the player presses a toolbar number that has shape in it, Loop will convert the shape into a ball of energy and throw it forward. The ball will fly for about 1 second and then self destruct, unless it hits a Chaotie before then. 

Note: The toolbar is filled up by picking up shapes out in the world or by loading it up from your inventory while you're at a nexus. Your inventory itself is filled up while you're at a nexus, by moving energy from your toolbar into your inventory. You can store up to 20 of each energy type in your inventory.

Damaging Chaoties: These crazy "minions of weird" generally come in sizes of small, medium, and ridiculous. Small ones can be dispatched with a single shot from Loop's abilities, but the larger ones require more effort to defeat.
