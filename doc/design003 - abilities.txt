----------------------------

There are 8 abilities that the player can unlock. He may use up to two abilities at a time, one bound to the LMB and the other bound to the RMB. Each ability requires and uses its own type of energy. Equipping an ability requires x amount of x type of energy be available in the player's inventory. Once equipped, the player may fire that ability up to 8 times before needing to reload. To reload, the player can either changes shapes at a nexus or press the R Key at any time. In order for the R key to work, the player must have the proper type energy in his toolbar. By default, abilities charge at a 1:1 ratio (shots : energy of the right kind in the toolbar), but that can be increased to 4:1 with preset slot stat mods.

Abilities do not have cooldowns / reuse timers unless one is specified.

The "default combat ability" is same thing as emptying a toolbar number slot to free up the space. When the player presses a number that has shape in it, the shape will fly out forward for 1 second or until it hits and destroys a Chaotie or another energy shape. If it doesn't hit anything, the shape will explode after 1s of flight, destroying itself and damaging the player if the player is within the blast radius. This works for all shapes.

Note: The toolbar is filled up by picking up shapes out in the world or by loading it up from your inventory while you're at a nexus. Your inventory itself is filled up while you're at a nexus, by moving energy from your toolbar into your inventory. You can store up to 20 of each energy type in your inventory.
