How to Play
===========

Requirements:
    Linux, Windows, MacOS
	Blender 2.69
	Video Card: AMD 5670 / Nvidia GTS450 or better
    CPU: Dual Core 1.8GHz AMD / Intel or better

Recomended:
    The game was built using...
    Operating System: 64Bit Linux (PCLinuxOS / Linux Mint 17 / Debian 7)
    Video Card: AMD R9 270 (Roughly the same as an Nvidia GTX750)
    CPU: AMD FX-8320 (8 Cores at 4GHz - Roughly the same as a 3GHz Intel i5)


Running the Game in General:
    
    NOTE: Eventually I will make a handy installer so the game runs like any other game in Linux and Windows. 
    Until then, you can do this:
    
    1. Download/Install Blender 2.69. Please note that some things only work in Blender version 2.69, so use it.
        https://www.blender.org/features/past-releases/2-69/
    2. Download and unzip the game.
        https://github.com/Tatwi/LoopDipole
    3. Launch Blender.
    4. Open start.blend.
    5. In the lower right area, under the "Standalone Player" heading, choose your resolution/options, and hit "Start".
    
    
Running on Linux Mint 17:
    1. Install Blender 2.69 with the package manager or apt.
    2. Download and unzip the game.
        https://github.com/Tatwi/LoopDipole
    3. Move the game folder to /opt/LoopDipole
        sudo mv LoopDipole /opt
    4. Make the folder writable, so that settings, profiles, and screenshots can be saved!
        sudo chown -R YOURUSERNAME:user /opt/LoopDipole
        chmod 777 -R /opt/LoopDipole
    4. Create a menu link for all users by copying the LoopDipole.desktop program launching shortcut file to /usr/share/applications folder.
        sudo cp LoopDipole.desktop /usr/share/applications
    5. Now all users can play the game like any other installed game, by clicking an icon in the program menu.


Game Play:
	The purpose of the game is to travel around the planet collecting
	different kinds of energy and using that energy to:
		1. Power Loop's alternate shapes.
		2. Power Loop's abilities.
		3. Solve the fountain puzzles.
		4. Destroy the Chaoties!
	Solve all the "Fountain Puzzles" to win the game!


Controls (Right Handed):
	W = Forward
	S = Reverse
	A = Left
	D = Right
	Left Control = Brake
	Left Shift = Turbo
	Spacebar = Glide


Controls (Left Handed):
	Arrow Up = Forward
	Arrow Down = Reverse
	Arrow Left = Left
	Arror Right = Right
	Right Control = Brake
	Right Shift = Turbo
	Numpad 0 = Glide (if you don't have a number pad on your keyboard you can still use the spacebar; The movement keys aren't used when gliding, so you don't really *need* to keep your fingers on them.)

Gliding:
    Shapes 1 - 4, hold Spacebar or Numpad 0 to maintain glide.
    Shape 1 purposely has a limited gliding range.
    Shapes 5 & 6, Spacebar toggles ON/OFF corner assist mode, which auto-drives around many corners.


Mouse:
	Movement while on the ground = turn left / right
	Movement while in the air = bank left/right, pitch up/down
	Left Button = Ability 1
	Right Button = Ability 2
	Middle Button = Chase Camera (Default)
	Mouse Wheel Up = Reverse Camera
	Mouse Wheel Down = Close Third Person Camera

Mouse Tips:
    - In the air, turning too quickly will cause a loss of forward momentum and altitude (as in "real life"). A well timed turbo can help you make sharper turns without losing altitude.
    - In the air, you can gain altitude by sweeping the mouse up over and over. Sweep up, lift mouse off the desk, move it backward, place it back down, repeat. A little effort goes a long way, so to speak!
    - On the ground, getting a feel when to steer with the keys or the mouse or both at the same time is a HUGE part of the game - you really can't do just one or the other in every situation! Explore their relationship with each of the shapes to get the most out of what the game has to offer. For instance, you can drive down the tallest twisty-ramps at 450KPH+ once you get used to it!

Change "Shape":
	Until UI is created...
	Number Pad 1 through 6


Other Keys:

	TAB = Toggle UI (not yet implimented)
	F = Interact with Puzzles (not yet implimented)
	R = Rescue/unstick if you flip over
	U = Toggle speedometer units from Kilometers/hour to Miles/hour
	1 through 0 = Use Energy to solve a Puzzle (not yet implimented)
	F1 = Chase Camera (Default)
	F2 = Close Third Person Camera
	F3 = Reverse Camera
	F4 = First Person Camera
	F5 = Spawn some testing targets to push around and shoot at
	F9 = Take a screenshot
	F10 = Save Game (nothing to really save at the moment though)
	F12 = Go home, reset shape to default (in case you get lost or just want to go home)
	ESC = Exit Game (without saving current data, until UI is completed)
