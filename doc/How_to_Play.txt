Running the Game:
    NOTE: Eventually I will make a handy installer so the game runs like any other game in Linux and Windows. Until then, do this:
    1. Download/Install Blender 2.69. Please note that some things only work in Blender version 2.69, so use it.
        https://www.blender.org/features/past-releases/2-69/
    2. Download and unzip the game.
        https://github.com/Tatwi/LoopDipole
    3. Launch Blender.
    4. Open level1.blend.
    5. In the lower right area, under the "Standalone Player" heading, choose your resolution/options, and hit "Start".


Game Play:
	The purpose of the game is to travel around the planet collecting
	different kinds of energy and using that energy to:
		1. Power Loop's alternate shapes.
		2. Power Loop's abilities.
		3. Solve the fountain puzzles.
		4. Destroy the Chaoties!
	Solve all the "Fountain Puzzles" to win the game!
