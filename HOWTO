========================
Working on .blend file
========================

To reduce the file size of the main game file, as GitHub has a file size limit and because it's generally a good idea, I have linked assets into the main game file using the library feature of Blender. As such, to use the loop_dipole_###.blend file, you will also need to download the assets directory. The easiest way to ensure you have what you need is to clone or download the repo. Your setup should look like so, 

assets/
loop_dipole_###.blend
