Playing the Game
==================

Controls:
	W = Forward
	S = Reverse
	A = Left
	D = Right
	Left Control = Brake
	Left Shift = Turbo
	Left Shift when in Mech Shape = Jump
	Spacebar = Glide
	Spacebar when in Tank or Mech Shape = Rotate Turret (not yet implimented)
	R = Resue if you flip over
	
Mouse:
	Movement while on the ground = turn left / right
	Movement while in the air = bank left/right, pitch up/down (a little)
	Left Button = Ability 1 (not yet implimented)
	Right Button = Ability 2 (not yet implimented)
	Middle Button = (not yet implimented)
	Mouse Wheel = (not yet implimented)

	Until UI is created...
	Number Pad 1 through 6 (only 1-4 work atm)

Other Keys:
	TAB = Toggle Inventory UI (not yet implimented)
	F = Interact with Puzzles (not yet implimented)
	1 through 0 = Use Energy to solve a Puzzle (not yet implimented)
	E = Recharge Energy (not yet implimented)
	Q = (not yet implimented)
	F1 through F4 = Cameras
	F12 = Reset Game
	ESC = Exit Game


How to Play:
	The purpose of the game is to travel around the planet collecting
	different kinds of energy and using that energy to:
		1. Power Loop's alternate shapes.
		2. Power Loop's abilities.
		3. Solve the fountain puzzles.
		4. Destroy the Chaoties!
	Solving the "Fountain Puzzles" will grant you more customization
	points to adjust the stats of Loop's shapes more to your liking.
	Also, solving all the puzzles on the six outer sides of the 
	cube planet will grant you access to the final level. Complete
	the final level and you win the game! 


========================
Working on .blend file
========================

To reduce the file size of the main game file, as GitHub has a file size limit and because it's generally a good idea, I have linked assets into the main game file using the library feature of Blender. As such, to use the loop_dipole_###.blend file, you will also need to download the assets directory. The easiest way to ensure you have what you need is to clone or download the repo. Your setup should look like so,
